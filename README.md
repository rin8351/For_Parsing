I am using the "undetected_chromedriver" library. 
Here is a link to it: https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver
This is an Optimized Selenium Chromedriver patch that does not start anti-bot services. It opens an additional Chrome window that allows you to simulate the behavior of a real person. Thus, the script parses the site and leaves no traces of the bot.
First you need to install the libraries from the requirements.txt file.
Don't forget to write your real username and password in the code.
